# odin-calculator

The Odin Project calculator will contain functions for all of the simple math operators typically found on basic calculators.

The calculator contains functions that take an operator and 2 numbers and calls one of the following operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

The project contains an HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions, an “Equals” key, a display for the calculator, and a “clear” button.

The calculator populates the display with the number clicked, calls an operator function based on the operator clicked, and populates the display with a correct answer when the "=" key is clicked.
